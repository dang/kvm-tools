Scripts to make kvm easier to use, day-to-day

How to use these scripts:

1. Check them out (duh...)
2. Make a directory to hold a virtual machine

mkdir -p ~/virtualization/test

3. Make an image for the machine

kvm-img create -f raw ~/virtualization/test/test.img 20G

4. Copy the kvm-run.conf and edit appropriately (setting at least IMGFILE)

cp /path/to/kvm-tools/kmv-run.conf ~/virtualization/test
vim ~/virtualization/test/kvm-run.conf

5. Run kvm

cd ~/virtualization/test
/path/to/kvm-tools/kvm-run

That's it.

Note on bridged networks:

For bridged networks to work, you must have the bridge setup ahead of time.  On
gentoo, this is dead easy.

1. Emerge usermode-utilities and bridge-utils

2. Set up your host configuration

/etc/conf.d/net:

bridge_br0="eth0"
RC_NEED_br0="net.eth0"
config_br0=( "dhcp" )
config_eth0=( "null" )


Symlink /etc/init.d/net.eth0 and /etc/init.d/net.br0 like normal.  The result
should be br0 with a dhcp'd IP and eth0 in it.

3. Set bridge mode in kvm-run.conf, optionally setting a name
